                            </header>
                            <p>We began by analyzing the mechanical energy a person could generate while pedaling, targeting a range of <strong>40–60 RPM</strong> and a sustained power output of <strong>50–150 W.</strong>
                                Using this input, we designed a transmission system composed of <strong>gears, chains, and cranks</strong> to convert rotational motion into linear displacement for the pump.</p>

                            </header>
                            <p>To optimize performance, we explored three mechanical configurations with varying crank lengths and linkage geometries.
                                Each design was analyzed using a combination of SolidWorks simulations, MATLAB modeling and Ansys to evaluate its dynamic behavior.
                            <a class="image featured"><img src="../../images/projects/water-pump/water-flow-analysis.jpeg" alt="" /></a>
                                We focused on key metrics such as piston displacement relative to crank angle, angular velocity versus translational speed, and the torque required to overcome hydraulic head.
                                These insights guided our selection of the most efficient and user-friendly configuration for sustained operation.</p>

                            <p>This project aimed to design a water pump system capable of supplying water to homes without access to electricity or external power sources.
                                The solution was a <strong>reciprocating pump powered by a bicycle</strong>, leveraging the energy output of an average human to deliver water efficiently and sustainably.</p>
                            <p>The system was divided into modular components, each playing a critical role in the overall functionality. The bicycle base served as the fixed frame, transmitting energy through a chain connected to the rotational module.
                                This module included gears, a shaft, bearings, and a crank mechanism that converted rotational motion into linear displacement. The pump module featured a reciprocating pump equipped with check valves and hoses to ensure consistent water flow. Supporting all of this was a guide system composed of structural supports and sliding rails, which maintained alignment and stability throughout operation.</p>
                            <p>The final design used a <strong>carbon steel transmission system</strong> and <strong>stainless steel pump components</strong> to resist corrosion.
                                The pump was validated to deliver 7.5 L/min at a height of 9 meters, with a calculated hydraulic power of 7.47 W well within the range of human capability.</p>
                            <p>We also developed a maintenance plan and proposed instrumentation using pedal RPM sensors, tachometers, and flow meters to monitor system performance.
                                The project was presented with CAD models, technical drawings, and a full installation manual.</p>
                            <p>This was a deeply interdisciplinary challenge, combining thermo fluid calculations, mechanical design, and human-centered engineering.
                                It taught me how to design for real-world constraints, validate performance through simulation, and deliver a solution that could make a tangible impact in underserved communities.</p>
